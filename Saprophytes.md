4. Differentiate the various types of aspergillosis in terms of:  
a. Predisposing factors  
b. Etiology  
c. Clinical disease  
d. Disease incidence (common or rare)  
e. Treatment

e. Treatment  
f. Laboratory identification  
g. Identify a mold that is a common causative agent  
9. Evaluate the following in determining whether the isolation of a common fungal saprophyte reflects an  
infection or contamination:  
a. Repeat cultures  
b. Quantity of colonies isolated  
c. Specimen source  
d. Patient's clinical condition (debilitated, immunocompromised)
10. Given an image of a microscopic preparation, classify fungi as septate or sparsely septate, hyaline or  
dematiaceous.  
11. Compare and contrast the microscopic features of Absidia, Mucor, and Rhizopus.  
12. Discuss ways to distinguish Acremonium from the subcutaneous pathogen Sporothrix schenckii.  
13. Given an image of a microscopic preparation, differentiate Aspergillus fumigatus from the other  
Aspergillus species.  
14. Compare and contrast colony and microscopic morphology of Penicillium, Paecilomyces, and  
Scopulariopsis.  
15. Evaluate laboratory, clinical, and/or epidemiological data (i.e., from case studies) to identify an infectious  
agent.  
16. Identify the fungus that was previously categorized as a parasite.
