# (Z) Septic transfusion case caused by a platelet pool with visible clotting due to contamination with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>

> BACKGROUND                                Contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) with                 Staphylococcus aureus                 is one of the most significant ongoing transfusion safety risks in developed countries.                                                        CASE REPORT                                This report describes a transfusion reaction in an elderly patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, transfused with a 4‐day‐old buffy coat PC through a central venous catheter. The transfusion was interrupted when a large fibrous clot in the PC obstructed infusion pump flow. Shortly afterward, a red blood cell (RBC) unit transfusion started. After septic symptoms were developed, the RBC transfusion was also interrupted. While the RBC unit tested negative for bacterial contamination, the PC and the patient samples were found to be contaminated with a                 S. aureus                 strain that exhibited the same phenotypic and genome sequencing profiles. The isolated                 S. aureus                 forms biofilms and produces the superantigen enterotoxin‐like U, which was detected in a sample of the transfused PCs. The patient received posttransfusion antibiotic treatment and had her original central line removed and replaced.                                                        DISCUSSION                                As the implicated PC had been tested for bacterial contamination during routine screening yielding negative results, this is a false‐negative transfusion sepsis case. Using a point‐of‐care test could have prevented the transfusion reaction. This report highlights the increasing incidence of                 S. aureus                 as a major PC contaminant with grave clinical implications. Importantly,                 S. aureus                 is able to interact with platelet components resulting in visible changes in PCs.                                                        CONCLUSION               Visual inspection of blood components before transfusion is an essential safety practice to interdict the transfusion of bacterially contaminated units.

> Genomic DNA was extracted from all isolates for whole genome sequencing (Illumina), which revealed that there were 1,761,267 bp of predicted coding sequence overlapping between all genomes with only 1995 single-nucleotide differences indicating the close relatedness of the genomes. #Illumina, #bioinformatics

> At the NHSBT, PCs are stored for 36 hours before sampling for sterility testing. Despite this long quarantine period, four contaminated units have been missed, all containing S. aureus, showing the characteristic slow growth of this bacterium.

> While one of the PC units was transfused causing patient morbidity, transfusion of the other three units was prevented because the presence of aggregates was noted during visual inspection before transfusion.
