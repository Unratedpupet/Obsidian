# (Z) Gene editing to prevent ventricular arrhythmias associated with cardiomyocyte cell therapy

  

> [!ABSTRACT]- ABSTRACT

> 

> Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) offer a promising cell-based therapy for myocardial infarction. However, the presence of transitory ventricular arrhythmias, termed engraftment arrhythmias (EAs), hampers clinical applications. We hypothesized that EA results from pacemaker-like activity of hPSC-CMs associated with their developmental immaturity. We characterized ion channel expression patterns during maturation of transplanted hPSC-CMs and used pharmacology and genome editing to identify those responsible for automaticity in vitro. Multiple engineered cell lines were then transplanted in vivo into uninjured porcine hearts. Abolishing depolarization-associated genes HCN4, CACNA1H, and SLC8A1, along with overexpressing hyperpolarization-associated KCNJ2, creates hPSC-CMs that lack automaticity but contract when externally stimulated. When transplanted in vivo, these cells engrafted and coupled electromechanically with host cardiomyocytes without causing sustained EAs. This study supports the hypothesis that the immature electrophysiological prolife of hPSC-CMs mechanistically underlies EA. Thus, targeting automaticity should improve the safety profile of hPSC-CMs for cardiac remuscularization.

> Electrical mapping studies in NHPs and pigs indicated that EA originates locally from the sites of cell transplant, suggesting that an abnormal impulse generation from the graft, rather than conduction defects (i.e., re-entry pathways), represents the major source of EA.

> We therefore hypothesized that the arrhythmogenic currents causing EA result from the presence of depolarizing fetal channels that are normally absent in adult vCMs and/or from the absence of hyperpolarizing channels that are normally present in the adult state.

> After screening over ten different cell lines, we found that simultaneous modification of four genes (knockout [KO] of HCN4, CACNA1H, and SLC8A1, coupled with knockin [KI] of KCNJ2 under the transcriptional control of the HCN4 promoter) eliminated automaticity in vitro without affecting the ability of the cell to fire APs when stimulated

> For instance, fetal to adult isoform switching of myofibril-related genes (TNNI1 to TNNI3, MYH6toMYH7, and MYL7 to MYL2) and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative metabolism were more strongly induced by in vivo transplantation

> At early time points, corresponding to the onset of EA in large animals, we saw strong expression of HCN4 and CACNA1H (whose protein products mediate If and ICaT, responsible for Na+/K+ and Ca2+ currents, respectively, and are involved in phase 4), while we detected barely any KCNJ2 transcript (which encodes for Kir2.1, responsible for the inward rectifying K+ current, IK1, one of the major repolarizing potassium currents).

> Overall, the expression patterns of HCN4, CACNA1H, and KCNJ2 correlate with the absence of phase 4 spontaneous depolarization in more mature hPSCCMs and vCMs.16

> Invasive electrophysiology studies in monkeys and pigs demonstrate that EA has a focal source, cannot be extinguished by overdrive pacing or directcurrent (DC) cardioversion, and cannot be induced by programmed electrical stimulation14,23; these findings favor local impulse generation rather than re-entry.

> Interestingly, single, double, and triple edits could reduce the beating rate and destabilize the rhythm, but they were insufficient to eliminate automaticity in vitro or EA in vivo (Figures 2, 3,and4). We eventually discovered that a quadruple edit (KO of HCN4, CACNA1H,andSLC8A1,along with overexpression of KCNJ2, which we termed MEDUSA) generated hESC-CMs that were quiescent yet excitable.

> Achieving electrically quiescent CMs required manipulation of Na+,Ca2+, and K+ channels and transporters, resulting in hyperpolarized cells that lacked diastolic depolarization currents. This indicates considerable redundancy in the circuitry underlying automaticity (perhaps not surprisingly, considering its importance to life).

> In conclusion, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms behind automaticity of hESC-CMs and strongly support the hypothesis that EA results from pacemaker-like activity in the graft that wanes as ion channels mature toward an adult state.
