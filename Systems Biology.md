## What is Systems Biology?

Over the past several decades we have learned an enormous amount about the biological "parts list" - the sequences, structures, and functions of the genes, proteins, and other molecules that make up living organisms. Now we are faced with the question of how these parts work together in pathways, cells, tissues, and organisms. There are many methods and approaches under the umbrella of systems biology, but all of them are directed toward some aspect of that question. The goal is to understand how biological systems normally function and also how they are disrupted in disease, so that we can design better therapies.

## Impact of Next Generation Sequencing

Major technological advances have been made in recent years that have revolutionized our ability to sequence DNA. Because of these advances, genomic approaches to studying biological questions have gone from something that was only performed in high-budget genomics centers to techniques that can be employed by any laboratory. In many ways this has revolutionized how we perform life science research, but these technologies are very data-intensive, so biologists today need to develop a new toolbox of bioinformatics skills to analyze and successfully interpret these data.

## Programming Languages

Can utilize [[R Language]] or Python to help with statistical analysis and processing.
