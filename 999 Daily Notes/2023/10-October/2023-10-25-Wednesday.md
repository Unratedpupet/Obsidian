# üìù Notes
- It gets frustrating listening to Becky complain about having to do extra work. I'm worried that she is suffering from depression, and wont do anything about it. 
	- She has such a hard time with the baby still.
- I managed to somewhat figure out [[Zotero]] integration to Obsidian. I also was able to find some research papers and how to read and annotate in Zotero. I found one article about machine learning and CPR outcomes which I look forward to reading.
	- It did unfortunately take me down a rabbit hole of procrastination.
