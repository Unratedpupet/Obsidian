# üìù Notes
- Halloween night. Picked up an extra 8 hours of OT. 
- To fix the plumbing for the heat was going to cost $1500. I'm going to do the repair myself. It should be one of two valves that needs replacing. It shouldn't take more than an hour to fix.
- I should get Nickypoo to fill out that Slate form for volunteering for HPEC committee. I don't think that my GPA is good enough for them to really give a great eval, but hopefully with time served, they will at least look into it.
	- I also need to get Dr. Carroll's signature to put on the form.
