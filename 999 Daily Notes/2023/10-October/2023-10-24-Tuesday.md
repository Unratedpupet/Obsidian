# 📝 Notes
- ### From yesterday: 
	-  I need to get on the laptop and find the daily note template setting to create the daily note in the monthly folder structure for the desktop 
	- [[Obsidian]] created, and placed the format into it.
- Becky is at work today, so it's just me and [[Fenrir]] today. I'm still finding myself getting a little frustrated with feeding. But I really just need to go with the flow. He'll stop when he's done, and he'll keep going when he's hungry. The bottles are bothering me. Maybe I should do a boil of them to see if there is any small residues stopping the venting action.
	- I've been making sure that they are clean and free of anything prior to putting them together. And it seems to be working well. There was still a few feedings that did not go great, but overall, he's getting what he needs.
- I got a little frustrated with the dogs when Fenn was crying. He had a few episodes of painful screaming. It feels bad when it happens, but I know it only lasts for a bit.
- I was able to get Todoist integrated with Obsidian. I really want to use it more. 
- I think I did an okay job with schoolwork. Though it was only the one class. I still might be able to use my time better. I had the baby all day, so I think I did fine for what I needed to do.
- Working tomorrow 15-07, need to make food. 
- I'd like to make bagels this weekend if I can, but I am working every night until Sat, and then Becky is going to work Sat.
- If I have time, I might want to explore some [[Bullet Journal]]ing. I think this is it, but who knows.
- I should explore using multiple desktops on the laptop to separate work/school/and pleasure. That might help me with procrastination.
- Do I let the baby sleep when I go to bed late, or feed him? It might be better to let him sleep as long as he wants.
- The current daily note template is a bit on the meh side with [[dataview]] plugin. I might need to look into that more. It should be in the documentation.
- I might want to look into [[Zotera]] or ReadWise.
