# 📝 Notes
- ### From yesterday: 
	-  I need to get on the laptop and find the daily note template setting to create the daily note in the monthly folder structure for the desktop 
	- [[Obsidian]] created, and placed the format into it.
- Becky is at work today, so it's just me and [[Fenrir]] today. I'm still finding myself getting a little frustrated with feeding. But I really just need to go with the flow. He'll stop when he's done, and he'll keep going when he's hungry. The bottles are bothering me. Maybe I should do a boil of them to see if there is any small residues stopping the venting action.
