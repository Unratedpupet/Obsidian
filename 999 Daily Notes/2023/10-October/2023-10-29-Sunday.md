# üìù Notes
- I'm feeling a bit off about the issue at work. I read over the policies, and per policy, it's not good. That being said, I am still okay about any outcome. I think it would be hard pressed to have anything serious happen.
- I have another test on Tuesday, which I am already not prepared for, but hopefully I can manage my time better, even though I'm busy. 
- The baby is doing great, and I'm grateful that he is eating easier than he has been.
- There is till an issue with syncing Obsidian through the git plugin.
- I need to look into Templater more or not have obsidian open a new daily note on it's own every time.
- The [[Programming for Bioinformatics]] project is going okay. I do need to do some work on it, and hopefully understand it more.
- [[Systems Biology]] project is still elusive for me. I'm not sure what I need to do for a hypothesis.
	- I need to watch the video of the class talking about it.
	- The recordings are up, and ready to watch.
- I need to put time into [[MCAT]] content review, and eventually [[UWorld]].
