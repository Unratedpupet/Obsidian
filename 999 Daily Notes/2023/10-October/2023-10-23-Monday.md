# Reflection

- [[Fenrir]] is doing very well. I do feel slightly bad that we have not been doing a lot of tummy time. I find that I'm hesitant to do it because he usually spits up when we put him in that position. But it is amazing to see his growth everyday. 
- I do feel anxiety and guilt when realizing that I don't put as much effort into school that I think I should. 
- I was able to repair the exterior of the window of Fenrir's room today. It has been a project that is long overdue, and did not take a lot of time. Hopefully it helps to insulate the room a little more from temperature changes and those fake ladybugs.
- The night was productive, but I am going to be later than I probably should.

# 📝 Notes
- Set up [[FileCloud]] tonight. Still need to do a lot of work on it to get filesharing, website, and remote access done. Once that is set up, can use it as a fileshare
- Might consider using [[NextCloud]], but that depends on how much trouble there is.
- I really want to make the effort to study more. Hopefully, using Obsidian will help me with that. Goals are to study for classes, but also [[MCAT]]. I need to make sure that I continue to use [[Anki]] and see if I can work enough to get a [[UWorld]] account.
- Created a bunch of new links and pages
- Did some decent studying in [[Systems Biology]] tonight.
	- Finished up the R tutorial, but still need some help with it. Hopefully the 15.3 tutorial will help with that.
	- [[Transcriptomic Data Analysis]] and [[Transcriptome Based Disease Classification]] are interesting points, and are generally interesting.
- I need to get on the laptop and find the daily note template setting to create the daily note in the monthly folder structure for the desktop 
- I need to find a good file structure for the files in obsidian #TODO
