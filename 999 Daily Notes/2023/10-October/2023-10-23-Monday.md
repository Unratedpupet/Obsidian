# 📝 Notes
- Set up [[FileCloud]] tonight. Still need to do a lot of work on it to get filesharing, website, and remote access done. Once that is set up, can use it as a fileshare
- Might consider using [[NextCloud]], but that depends on how much trouble there is.
- I really want to make the effort to study more. Hopefully, using Obsidian will help me with that. Goals are to study for classes, but also [[MCAT]]. I need to make sure that I continue to use [[Anki]] and see if I can work enough to get a [[UWorld]] account.
