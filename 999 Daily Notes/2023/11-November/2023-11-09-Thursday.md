# üìù Notes
- Had a big talk with Becky yesterday, and we decided that medical school is probably not in the best interest of the family. Going to attempt to pivot schooling to something else. Want to finish bachelors, but might need to do a masters/PhD to allow for remote work. Maybe in bioinformatics.
- Very busy first half of work tonight. 
- [[Fenrir]] went to the doctor's for his suspected reflux. Given pepcid. Admin 2x per day.
	- He's a happy boy
	- Silly as all heck, trying to eat Mommy boo's face.
