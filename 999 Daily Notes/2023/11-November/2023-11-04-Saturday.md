# üìù Notes
- Waiting for payday, then going to make sure to get the Gottman courses.
- I need to work on the research [[Systems Biology Project One]].
	- Set up the script to do the Trimming. Which is currently running 1+ hour. 
	- Next is mapping
- I need to make sure that I get study time in for the immunohematology exam on Monday.
- It would be nice to figure out the template format a bit more so that the modified header isn't just bad code, and actually the right thing.
