Certainly! K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for data clustering and partitioning. It's a way to group similar data points together based on their features. K-means is relatively simple and effective for many clustering tasks.

Here's a detailed explanation of how K-means clustering works and how it is performed:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Choose the number of clusters (K) you want to divide your data into. This is a hyperparameter that you need to set beforehand.
   - Randomly select K data points from your dataset as initial cluster centroids. These data points represent the initial centers of the clusters.

2. **Assignment**:
   - For each data point in your dataset, calculate the distance between that data point and each of the K cluster centroids. Common distance metrics used include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or other suitable distance measures.
   - Assign the data point to the cluster associated with the nearest centroid. This forms the initial clusters.

3. **Update**:
   - Recalculate the cluster centroids by computing the mean of all the data points assigned to each cluster.
   - These new centroids represent the updated cluster centers.

4. **Iteration**:
   - Repeat the Assignment and Update steps until a stopping condition is met. Common stopping conditions include:
     - No further changes in cluster assignments.
     - A maximum number of iterations have been reached.
     - Convergence, where the centroids stabilize.

5. **Result**:
   - When the algorithm converges, you have your final clusters. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

6. **Evaluation** (optional):
   - You can assess the quality of your clustering results using various metrics such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

Key Points:
- K-means clustering aims to minimize the distance between data points within the same cluster (intra-cluster distance) while maximizing the distance between data points from different clusters (inter-cluster distance).
- The algorithm is sensitive to the initial placement of cluster centroids, which can affect the final result. Multiple initializations and averaging the results are common practices.
- K-means is relatively fast and can handle large datasets, but it assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized, which may not be the case in all scenarios.

K-means clustering is widely used in various fields, including image segmentation, customer segmentation, and document classification, among others, where finding natural groupings in data is essential.
