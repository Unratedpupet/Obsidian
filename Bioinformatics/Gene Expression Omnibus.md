[Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)Links to an external site.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)Â  is a public repository for next-generation sequencing, microarray, and related omics data. Investigators deposit their raw data and corresponding metadata in GEO in a standardized format to make it freely available to the scientific community. The great majority of GEO deposits are gene expression experiments. Some of the experiments in GEO have been manually curated and provide advanced data visualization and analysis, including clustering and interactive heatmaps. These experiments can be found in GEO Datasets.
