Notes:

# Unit 4  Hemolytic Anemias, AIHAs, and Drug induced  HAs

## Reading Assignment: Chapter 21

## Objectives of this session:

Upon completing the reading assignments, participating in class, and studying the lecture notes, the student will be able to:

- Classification of Hemolysis
	- Non-Immune Hemolysis
		- Bacterial contamination
		- Improper handling
		- Mechanical hemolysis/Faulty equipment
		- Drugs or hypotonic solutions
		- Intrinsic RBC defects
	- Immune Hemolysis
		- Intravascular hemolysis
			- Lysis of RBCs within the blood vessel
			- **Complete complement activation**
				- hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria
		- Extravascular hemolysis
			- Lysis of RBCs outside the blood vessel
			- Ag-Ab complexes form in circulation
			- **Incomplete complement activation**
			- Immunoglobulin coated cells are removed by the reticuloendothelial system (RES)

1. Compare intravascular and extravascular hemolysis with regard to:

a. Site of occurrence in patient
	Intravascular would be in circulation. Extravascular RBCs ingested in liver, spleen and bone marrowb. Type of antibody involved  
c. Complement activation  
	Intravascular hemolysis causes complete complement while extravascular causes incomplete complement activation
d. Clinical symptoms  
e. Laboratory findings

2. Define immune hemolytic anemia.  
	1. A medical condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells by the immune system. In this condition, the immune system mistakenly recognizes the body's own red blood cells as foreign invaders and mounts an immune response against them. This can lead to the premature destruction of red blood cells, resulting in anemia, where there is a deficiency of red blood cells in the bloodstream.
	2. Has two forms
		1. Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (wAIHA)
			1. In this form of the condition, the immune system primarily attacks red blood cells at body temperature (37°C). It is often associated with the production of autoantibodies known as "warm antibodies."
		2. Cold Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (cAIHA)
			1. In cAIHA, the immune system attacks red blood cells when they are exposed to cold temperatures. This condition is associated with the production of "cold antibodies."
3. Distinguish between immune and nonimmune hemolytic anemia.  
4. Differentiate among the three types of hemolytic anemia.  
5. Explain why an EDTA sample is preferred when performing a direct antiglobulin test (DAT).

6. Discuss the connection between the DAT and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) based on laboratory findings.

7. Explain when a DAT is indicated.

8. Given DAT and indirect antiglobulin testing (IAT) results, determine the type of antibody present.

9. Given clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, determine those that would alert a physician to suspect hemolytic anemia.

10. Explain the differences among the three types of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).  
11. Given serological results, distinguish between benign and pathological cold agglutinin diseases.

12. Describe paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) with regard to etiology and laboratory findings.

13. Explain the biphasic hemolysin found in PCH and the Donath-Landsteiner test.  
14. Describe the proper handling of specimens when an investigation for cold autoagglutinins is requested.

15. Given cold agglutinin disease results, propose potential serological problems and possible solutions when testing the patient's red cells and serum.

16. Given serological results, distinguish between cold-reactive and warm-reactive autoantibodies.

17. State the concerns of treating patients with warm AIHA.

18. Given warm agglutinin disease results, propose potential serological problems and possible solutions when testing the patient's red cells and serum.

19. When evaluating a positive DAT, explain the importance of the patient’s transfusion and medication history.

20. State the autoantibody most often associated with:  
	a. Mycoplasma pneumonia  
	b. Infectious mononucleosis  
	c. Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria  
	d. Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia

21. Explain the four mechanisms of immune drug-induced hemolytic anemia.  
22. Given serological results and patient history, evaluate the type of drug-induced hemolytic anemia.

23. Explain the principle and mechanism of the reagent Rabbit Erythrocyte Stroma Test (R.E.S.T.®) when used to facilitate antibody identification for a patient with cold agglutinin disease.

24. Explain the principle and mechanism of the reagent W.A.R.M.™ when used to facilitate antibody identification for a patient with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

25. Given pre-transfusion serological results including an antibody identification panel, determine if the patient has an alloantibody in the presence of an autoantibody.

26.  Discuss the implications of initiating daratumumab therapy for a patient with multiple myeloma, specifically:

-  What does this therapy target and how?
-  Why is this an issue for pre-transfusion testing purposes?
-  What tests in pre-transfusion are directly affected by daratumumab administration?
-  What can be done to help facilitate pre-transfusion testing when daratumumab is going to be administered?

27.  Discuss the implications of initiating anti-CD47 therapy for a patient, specifically:

1. What does this therapy target and how?
2. What diseases/conditions can this therapy help to mitigate?
3. Why is this an issue for pre-transfusion testing purposes?
4. What tests in pre-transfusion are directly affected by anti-CD47 therapy administration?
5. What can be done to help facilitate pre-transfusion testing when anti-CD47 therapy is going to be initiated?
