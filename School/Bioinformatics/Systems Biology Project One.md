Notes:
- Going to compare Heart and Skeletal muscle tissues.
	- Both are muscles, however heart has automaticity.
	- Did get one research paper on it that is in Zotero, still need to finish reading, annotating, and importing. #TODO 
- The project should follow modules 12-17 for the actual work, but still needs to be written using the format given.

## HPC Work
- Running the TRIMMING using trim_galore. Took a little bit to figure out the for loops in bash, but working now for 1+ hour. #TODO  
- Next is going to be the MAPPING, which should also take time. I hope, I finished the mapping.slurm script, but will have to wait to see what happens. #TODO 
- After the MAPPING, I need to run the SORTING and INDEXING
	- It is the BAMINDEX.slurm file that still needs to be scripted #TODO
