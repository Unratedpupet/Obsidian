### Starting Points:

1. **Understanding Financial Markets**: Before diving into coding, it's essential to have a basic understanding of financial markets, trading strategies, and the types of assets you might trade (like stocks, bonds, forex, etc.).
    
2. **Python Basics**: Ensure your Python skills are solid, particularly in areas like data handling (with pandas), numerical computations (with NumPy), and perhaps some data visualization (with matplotlib or seaborn).
    
3. **Learn About Trading Algorithms**: Familiarize yourself with different types of trading algorithms, like mean reversion, momentum, and machine learning-based strategies.
    
4. **Data Acquisition**: Learn how to obtain financial data. This can be historical data for backtesting or real-time data for live trading. You can use APIs from financial data providers like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or others.
    
5. **Backtesting**: Before running any algorithm in a live market, it's crucial to backtest your strategy to see how it would have performed in the past. This involves simulating trades with historical data.
    
6. **Risk Management**: Understand the basics of risk management to protect your capital.
    
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Be aware of the legal aspects and compliance requirements in your region for algorithmic trading.

# Environment 
- After copying the repo...
- pip install virtualenv
- virtualenv algo_trader

```Python
.\algo_trader\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When done using the environment, make sure to deactivate with '''deactivate'''

## Libraries
- [[pandas]]
- [[matplotlib]]
- [[yfinance]]
	- Start with yfinance due to simplicity, but move to [[Alpha Vantage]] later.
- [[numpy]]

### Generate Trading Signals

Trading signals are generated based on the crossover of the moving averages. The typical logic is:

- **Buy Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA.

# Machine Learning

### Understanding the Approach

In algorithmic trading, machine learning can be used to predict future price movements, identify trading opportunities, or optimize portfolios. Common approaches include:

1. **Supervised Learning for Price Prediction**: Using historical data to predict future prices or price movements.
2. **Classification for Trading Signals**: Classifying future price movement as up or down, essentially turning it into a binary classification problem.
3. **Unsupervised Learning for Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns or clusters in trading data without predefined labels.
4. **Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management**: Applying reinforcement learning to optimize trading strategies and portfolio allocations.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Simple ML Model:

We can start with a basic supervised learning model that predicts whether the stock price will go up or down based on historical data.

#### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

- Collect historical price data. You might also want to include other features like volume, technical indicators (like RSI, MACD), or even external data like market sentiment.
- Preprocess the data: handle missing values, normalize or scale the data, and possibly create lag features (previous days' prices).

#### 2. Feature Engineering

- Create features that the model will learn from. These could include historical price movements, technical indicators, or derived statistical features.
- Define your target variable, which could be the next day's price direction (up/down).

#### 3. Model Selection

- Choose a machine learning model. For starters, models like logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests are good. As you advance, you might explore models like gradient boosting or neural networks.

#### 4. Training and Testing

- Split your data into training and testing sets.
- Train your model on the training set.
- Test the model on the testing set to evaluate its performance.

#### 5. Evaluation

- Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics, like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score for classification tasks. For regression tasks, you might use metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- Perform cross-validation for a more robust evaluation.

#### 6. Iteration

- Based on the model's performance, iterate on your approach. This might involve tweaking your features, trying different models, or adjusting your model's parameters.
