### Starting Points:

1. **Understanding Financial Markets**: Before diving into coding, it's essential to have a basic understanding of financial markets, trading strategies, and the types of assets you might trade (like stocks, bonds, forex, etc.).
    
2. **Python Basics**: Ensure your Python skills are solid, particularly in areas like data handling (with pandas), numerical computations (with NumPy), and perhaps some data visualization (with matplotlib or seaborn).
    
3. **Learn About Trading Algorithms**: Familiarize yourself with different types of trading algorithms, like mean reversion, momentum, and machine learning-based strategies.
    
4. **Data Acquisition**: Learn how to obtain financial data. This can be historical data for backtesting or real-time data for live trading. You can use APIs from financial data providers like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or others.
    
5. **Backtesting**: Before running any algorithm in a live market, it's crucial to backtest your strategy to see how it would have performed in the past. This involves simulating trades with historical data.
    
6. **Risk Management**: Understand the basics of risk management to protect your capital.
    
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Be aware of the legal aspects and compliance requirements in your region for algorithmic trading.

# Environment 
- After copying the repo...
- pip install virtualenv
- virtualenv algo_trader

```Python
.\algo_trader\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When done using the environment, make sure to deactivate with '''deactivate'''

## Libraries
- [[pandas]]
- [[matplotlib]]
- [[yfinance]]
	- Start with yfinance due to simplicity, but move to [[Alpha Vantage]] later.
- [[numpy]]

### Generate Trading Signals

Trading signals are generated based on the crossover of the moving averages. The typical logic is:

- **Buy Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA.
