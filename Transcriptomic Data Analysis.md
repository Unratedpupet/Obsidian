## Overview

You have completed an RNASeq experiment and determined the expression level of the genes in your samples. So now what? How do you relate these lists of numbers to the underlying biology of the cells and tissues you are studying? One of the first steps is to consider how your samples are related based on their gene expression pattern, or conversely, to consider how the expression of groups of genes is related across samples. In this lesson, we will explore three methods for visualizing these relationships: clustering, heatmaps, and principal component analysis (PCA). These techniques can reveal novel sample relationships, such as new disease subtypes, common gene expression regulatory mechanisms, or pathways or biological processes that contribute to the differential phenotype of the samples.
